    "## About Grok 4\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "* **Launched July 9, 2025** as the successor to Grok 3, available in two tiers: **Grok 4** (standard) and **Grok 4 Heavy**, a multi-agent version for more complex reasoning.\n",
    "* Promoted by Elon Musk as the “smartest AI in the world” with PhD-level capabilities across multiple domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Upgrades\n",
    "* **Benchmarked performance**:\n",
    "  * Scored \\~25.4% on the “Humanity’s Last Exam” (HLE), outperforming many peers; Grok 4 Heavy scored \\~44.4%.\n",
    "  * Ranks third overall in LMArena against models like Google Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI’s o3/4o.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Enhanced reasoning (“Think Mode”)**: Thinks step-by-step via first‑principles logic, outperforming GPT‑4o and Claude in science/math benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Massive context window**: Supports up to 256,000 tokens via API (standard around 130,000 tokens), enabling analysis of very large documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multimodal & tool support**: Handles text, images, voice, and real-time search; includes a “Voice Mode” with real-time camera vision and speech. Tools and structured function calls are supported .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access & Pricing\n",
    "* **Grok 4 Standard**: \\$30/month\n",
    "* **Grok 4 Heavy** (multi-agent): \\$300/month—branded under “SuperGrok Heavy”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Curious features\n",
    "* **Companion feature**: Grok 4 introduced animated avatars (anime “Ani,” red-panda “Rudi”).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integration & Use\n",
    "* **API & enterprise**: Available through xAI’s API and being offered via cloud hyperscaler partnerships.\n",
    "* **In Tesla vehicles**: Rolling out in-car support via a software update on July 13, 2025 .\n",
    "* **Voice + vision**: You can speak and show what’s in front of you; Grok responds contextually—great for instant visual insight tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "Grok 4 is a high-powered, multimodal AI with enhanced reasoning, an enormous context window, and real-time search & tool use. It comes in two tiers, starting at \\$30/month and going up to \\$300/month for the multi-agent variant."

    "## How to use Grok 4 with LangChain\n",
    "Here’s how you can use **Grok 4** with **LangChain**, powered by the official `langchain-xai` integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install the Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, install the xAI provider package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --upgrade langchain-xai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Set Up API Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtain your xAI API key from your xAI account and either export it as an environment variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export XAI_API_KEY=\"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or pass it directly when instantiating `ChatXAI`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Instantiate Grok 4 via LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Python interface like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_xai import ChatXAI\n",
    "\n",
    "llm = ChatXAI(\n",
    "    model=\"grok-4\",        # Or \"grok-4-0709\", the latest alias\n",
    "    temperature=0.7,\n",
    "    max_tokens=None,\n",
    "    timeout=None,\n",
    "    max_retries=2,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Send Messages or Use Streaming\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "messages = [\n",
    "    (\"system\", \"You are an AI assistant.\"),\n",
    "    (\"human\", \"What's the weather in Madrid on July 19?\")\n",
    "]\n",
    "ai_msg = llm.invoke(messages)\n",
    "print(ai_msg.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For streaming output:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "chat = ChatXAI(model=\"grok-4\", temperature=0.5)\n",
    "for chunk in chat.stream(\"Tell me something fun about Valencia\"):\n",
    "    print(chunk.content, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### 5. Add Web Search Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Enable Grok’s real-time search integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "llm = ChatXAI(\n",
    "  model=\"grok-4\",\n",
    "  search_parameters={\n",
    "    \"mode\": \"auto\",\n",
    "    \"max_search_results\": 3,\n",
    "    \"from_date\": \"2025-07-01\",\n",
    "    \"to_date\": \"2025-07-18\",\n",
    "  }\n",
    ")\n",
    "result = llm.invoke([(\"human\",\"Summarize recent xAI news\")])\n",
    "print(result.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Use Advanced Features\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "structured = llm.with_structured_output(YourPydanticModel)\n",
    "msg = structured.invoke(\"Tell me a joke about cats\")\n",
    "print(msg)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi‑agent / “Heavy” Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a **SuperGrok Heavy** subscription, you can specify `\"grok-4-heavy\"` to leverage multi-agent reasoning for more complex workflows.\n",
