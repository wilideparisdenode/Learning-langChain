    "Think of a **Runtime** as a \"backpack\" that the AI agent carries around while it's working. This backpack contains three important things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context**: Static information the agent needs (like the user's name, database connections, or settings)\n",
    "- **Store**: A place to save and remember things long-term (like user preferences)\n",
    "- **Stream writer**: A way to send updates or progress messages while working\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like giving your agent all the tools and information it needs before sending it off to do a job."

    "## Why do we say that the LangChain Agents run on LangGraph's runtime under the hood?\n",
    "When you create an agent using LangChain's `create_agent` function, it doesn't actually build everything from scratch. Instead, it uses LangGraph's runtime system to do the heavy lifting behind the scenes (\"under the hood\" means \"secretly in the background\").\n",

    "## What does this LangChain lingo means?\n",
    "As usual, the LangChain team delights us with some lingo in the documentation about Runtime that sounds like Chinese for the beginner student:\n",
    "* \"Runtime context provides dependency injection for your tools and middleware. Instead of hardcoding values or using global state, you can inject runtime dependencies (like database connections, user IDs, or configuration) when invoking your agent. This makes your tools more testable, reusable, and flexible\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does this mean in simple terms?\n",
    "Let us break this down with a simple analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem: Hardcoding vs. Dependency Injection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imagine you're writing a function that sends an email:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Bad way (hardcoding):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def send_email():\n",
    "    user_name = \"John\"  # Hardcoded - always John!\n",
    "    email = \"john@example.com\"  # Hardcoded - always this email!\n",
    "    # Send email...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is like writing someone's address directly on a letter in permanent marker. If you want to send a letter to someone else, you have to write a whole new letter!\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good way (dependency injection):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def send_email(user_name, email):  # These are \"injected\"\n",
    "    # Send email to whoever you pass in...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can reuse the same function for anyone by just passing different names and emails!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What \"Dependency Injection\" Means in Simple Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Dependency injection\"** is a fancy term that means: **\"Give the function what it needs from the outside, instead of building it in.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like:\n",
    "- **Hardcoding** = A coffee maker with the coffee beans permanently glued inside\n",
    "- **Dependency injection** = A coffee maker where you can add whatever beans you want each time\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters for Runtime Context\n",
    "\n",
    "With Runtime context:\n",
    "- **Testable**: You can test with fake data (like a fake database) without breaking anything\n",
    "- **Reusable**: The same tool works for different users - just pass different user IDs\n",
    "- **Flexible**: You can easily change settings or connections without rewriting code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Your tool gets the user_id from runtime context\n",
    "# instead of having \"user123\" hardcoded inside it\n",
    "def get_user_preferences(runtime: ToolRuntime):\n",
    "    user_id = runtime.context.user_id  # Injected when agent runs!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the same tool works for any user automatically."
