    "We are seeing **two different behaviors because the middleware is actually switching the underlying model**, and the two models respond very differently to the same “office intern” roleplay.\n",

    "Inside `state_based_model` we decide based on:\n",

    "message_count = len(request.messages)\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Why Claude “breaks character” and confesses\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second conversation, the assistant messages we supplied include statements like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* “Yes, I gave it a light watering this morning.”\n",
    "* “It’s sprouted two new leaves…”\n",
    "* “I rotated it a quarter turn…”\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the assistant **claiming it performed real-world actions and observations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different models tolerate roleplay differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **gpt-4o-mini** tends to stay in-character as “an office intern,” but still hedges (“I didn’t water it, but I can remind someone…”).\n",
    "* **Claude** is typically much more strict about not pretending it took real-world actions. So when it sees a conversation where “it” has been claiming it watered/rotated/observed the plant, it may **correct the record** and say, essentially: *I’m an AI; I didn’t actually do those things.*\n",
    "\n",
    "So the “I should be honest… I’m actually Claude…” part is basically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* triggered by the **model switch** + its **anti-deception preference**\n",
    "* amplified by the fact that we provided prior assistant turns where it claimed real physical actions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One subtlety: what exactly is being counted?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our comment we say `request.messages` is a shortcut for `request.state[\"messages\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on how `create_agent` constructs the request, `request.messages` may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* just the conversation messages you pass, **or**\n",
    "* those messages **plus** the system prompt inserted as a `SystemMessage`\n",
    "\n",
    "But in our observed run it doesn’t matter much:\n",
    "\n",
    "* call #1 would be 1 (or 2 with system)\n",
    "* call #2 would be 11 (or 12 with system)\n",
    "  Either way, the second call crosses `> 10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other options to consider\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid feeding “fake real-world actions” into the history** if you want strict models to behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Instead of `AIMessage(content=\"Yes, I watered it\")`, use something like:\n",
    "     “I’m not physically there, but based on our checklist…”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Route on something other than raw message count**, e.g. approximate token count, or only count *user* messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   message_count = sum(m.type == \"human\" for m in request.messages)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   That prevents long back-and-forth assistant chatter from tripping the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Keep persona consistent across models** (same system prompt, same “rules”), but accept that some models will still refuse to “act human” in ways that imply real-world actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **If you want roleplay consistency, don’t mix models mid-thread.**\n",

    "   * Switching models often causes “persona drift” even when prompts are identical.\n"
