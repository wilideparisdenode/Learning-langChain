    "    * Handle complex, multi-step tasks that require planning and decomposition.\n",
    "        * Break down complex tasks into discrete steps. \n",
    "    * Manage large amounts of context through file system tools.\n",
    "    * Delegate work to specialized subagents for context isolation.\n",
    "    * **Persist memory across conversations and threads**.\n",
    "        * Extend agents with persistent memory across threads **using LangGraph’s Store**.\n",
    "* For simpler use cases, consider using LangChain’s create_agent or building a custom LangGraph workflow."
