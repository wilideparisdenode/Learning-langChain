# STEP 4: Create the Agent (NEW LANGCHAIN 1.0 WAY)
# =============================================================================

# create_agent is the new standard in LangChain 1.0
# - Replaces the deprecated create_react_agent from langgraph.prebuilt
# - Uses system_prompt instead of state_modifier (clearer naming)
# - Still builds on LangGraph runtime under the hood
# - Handles the message flow automatically
# - Creates the proper state structure (with the 'messages' key)

agent = create_agent(
    model=model,
    tools=tools,
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant that can do math and tell jokes. "
                  "Always be friendly and clear in your responses."
)

# =============================================================================
# WHAT'S HAPPENING UNDER THE HOOD
# =============================================================================
# The 'agent' variable now contains a complete LangGraph compiled graph:
# 
# 1. It has a STATE that tracks the conversation (messages list)
# 2. It has NODES:
#    - "agent" node: Where the LLM thinks and decides what to do
#    - "tools" node: Where tools actually execute
# 3. It has EDGES connecting these nodes
# 4. It follows the ReAct pattern: Reason → Act → Observe (repeat)
#
# Agent Chat UI expects this specific structure with the 'messages' key!
# The create_agent function ensures this contract is met automatically.
# =============================================================================

# This allows the agent to be imported by other files
