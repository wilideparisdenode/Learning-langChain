    "## What is Semantic Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic search** is a search technique that understands the **meaning** (semantics) of your query rather than just matching exact keywords. Instead of looking for exact word matches, it finds content that is conceptually similar to your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this code an example of semantic search?**\n",
    "- Traditional keyword search would look for exact words like \"Gartner\" or \"percentage\"\n",
    "- Semantic search converts both your question AND the document chunks into numerical vectors (embeddings)\n",
    "- It then finds chunks whose vectors are closest in mathematical space to your question's vector\n",
    "- This means it can find relevant answers even if the exact wording is different"
