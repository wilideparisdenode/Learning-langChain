      "The journalist writed an article called Untangling Dallas: A Short Guide to the JFK Assassination Theories\n",
      "The article was about Lone gunman, conspiracies, and a decades‑long puzzle\n",
      "This is the body of the article:\n",
      " On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. The event sparked a torrent of theories that have persisted for generations. Here are the top ideas that recur in textbooks, documentaries, and conversations, with a note on what the evidence says today.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) The official story: Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. The Warren Commission (1964) concluded that Oswald fired three shots from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, striking Kennedy and Governor Connally. The Commission found no provable conspiracy and handed a simple explanation to a shaken nation. Critics have challenged some ballistic and investigative details, but this remains the governing account in most historical surveys.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) A conspiracy involving multiple shooters. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1979 concluded Kennedy was probably killed as a result of a conspiracy, likely with more than one gunman. The committee could not identify all participants or the full scope of the plot, but it has kept alive the possibility of a coordinated effort beyond Oswald alone. The key point: there is no single, universally agreed culprit in this version.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) The grassy knoll second shooter theory. A familiar image in popular culture is a shooter from the grassy knoll near Dealey Plaza. This theory has fed the idea of a hidden conspirator. The HSCA’s acoustic analysis once suggested a second gunman, but subsequent research questioned the method and its conclusions, leaving the theory as a debated possibility rather than a proven fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) CIA, Mafia, and anti‑Castro exile involvement. A well‑worn variant ties Kennedy’s aggressive push to roll back CIA covert actions and hardLine stance toward Cuba to retaliation from powerful adversaries, including organized crime figures and anti‑Castro exiles. Proponents point to a web of Cold War tensions and undisclosed relationships, but definitive, widely accepted evidence is elusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Other political plots (LBJ and foreign powers). Some accounts implicate Lyndon B. Johnson in a political maneuver to assume the presidency, while others invoke foreign players such as Cuba or the Soviet Union. These theories often hinge on motive and secrecy, yet they lack the conclusive documentation that would elevate them above speculative rumor in mainstream scholarship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current status: After decades of releases, a large portion of government files related to the case has been made public, but some materials remain redacted or unreleased. The historical consensus still gives the strongest weight to the lone gunman explanation for many scholars, while conspiracy theories persist in the public imagination due to gaps in evidence, contradictory testimony, and Cold War paranoia. For anyone seeking the truth, the most reliable approach is to examine primary sources, scholarly analyses, and the evolving texture of declassified documents as they come to light.\n"
