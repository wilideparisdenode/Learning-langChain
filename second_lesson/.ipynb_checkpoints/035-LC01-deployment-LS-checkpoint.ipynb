    "# LangChain 1.0 Agent Deployment: Deployment with LangSmith\n",
    "* LangSmith provides a managed hosting platform designed for agent workloads.\n",
    "* Traditional hosting platforms are built for stateless, short-lived web applications, while LangGraph is purpose-built for stateful, long-running agents that require persistent state and background execution.\n",
    "* LangSmith handles the infrastructure, scaling, and operational concerns so you can deploy directly from your repository.\n",
    "* In order to do that, you will need :\n",
    "    * A GitHub account.\n",
    "    * A LangSmith account (free to sign up).\n",
    "* To learn more about how to deploy your agent with LangSmith, see the [documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/deploy)."
