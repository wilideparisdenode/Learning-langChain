    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "What exactly is LangSmith? How does it help you? And how has it evolved to support the new LangChain 1.0 and LangGraph 1.0 ecosystem?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will explain everything in simple terms, with clear examples and analogies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Think of it this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangChain/LangGraph** = Your car (the application you build)\n",
    "- **LangSmith** = Your car's dashboard + mechanic shop + test track\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a car dashboard shows you speed, fuel, and engine status, LangSmith shows you what's happening inside your LLM application. And just like a mechanic shop helps you fix problems, LangSmith helps you debug and improve your agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in!"

    "### The Simple Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangSmith is a platform that helps you build better LLM applications by showing you what's happening, testing if it works, and making it easy to deploy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Pillars of LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith has three main superpowers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **👁️ Observability (\"See what's happening\")** - Tracing and monitoring\n",
    "2. **✅ Evaluation (\"Test if it works\")** - Quality assurance and testing\n",
    "3. **🚀 Deployment (\"Ship it to production\")** - Hosting and scaling\n",

    "## Part 2: Pillar 1 - Observability (See What's Happening)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you built an agent that:\n",
    "1. Searches the web\n",
    "2. Reads a document\n",
    "3. Generates an answer\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes it gives wrong answers. **Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is the search returning bad results?\n",
    "- Is the LLM misunderstanding the document?\n",
    "- Is the prompt confusing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without LangSmith, you're debugging blind.** 🙈\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith **records every single step** your agent takes. This is called **tracing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a flight recorder (black box) in an airplane - it records everything so you can understand what happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Gets Traced?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith records:\n",
    "- 📝 **Every prompt** sent to the LLM\n",
    "- 💬 **Every response** from the LLM\n",
    "- 🔧 **Every tool call** (search, database query, etc.)\n",
    "- 📊 **Results** from each tool\n",
    "- ⏱️ **How long** each step took\n",
    "- 💰 **How much it cost** (tokens used)\n",
    "- ❌ **Any errors** that occurred\n",

    "### Q: Can I use LangSmith with other frameworks?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Yes! LangSmith works with any Python code that calls LLMs. You can manually instrument non-LangChain code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: Does LangSmith store my data?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Yes, traces are stored in LangSmith. But you can:\n",
    "- Control what gets traced\n",
    "- Self-host LangSmith\n",
    "- Use data retention policies\n",
    "- LangSmith is SOC 2 Type 2, GDPR, and HIPAA compliant\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: How do I debug without LangSmith?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** You can use `print()` statements, but it's much harder. LangSmith shows you the complete picture with nice visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: Can I deploy without LangSmith Deployments?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Yes! You can deploy to AWS, GCP, Azure, or any other platform. But LangSmith Deployments makes it much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: How is Studio different from Jupyter notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Jupyter is for running code. Studio is specifically for testing agents visually. It shows execution flow, lets you replay threads, and updates when you change code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: Can I use LangSmith for production monitoring?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Yes! That's one of its main uses. All production traces are automatically captured, and you can set up alerts, dashboards, and analytics."

    "## Part 11: Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Development\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always use Studio** - See your agent's execution visually\n",
    "2. **Use descriptive project names** - `my-chatbot-v1` not `test`\n",
    "3. **Add metadata to traces** - User IDs, session IDs help debugging\n",
    "4. **Tag your traces** - Makes filtering easier\n",
    "5. **Review traces regularly** - Learn from your agent's behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with a small dataset** - 10-20 examples to begin\n",
    "2. **Add failing cases** - Every bug should become a test\n",
    "3. **Use multiple evaluators** - Correctness, helpfulness, safety, etc.\n",
    "4. **Compare versions** - Always A/B test improvements\n",
    "5. **Automate evaluation** - Run tests before deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Production\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample traces in production** - Don't trace 100% (use 10-20%)\n",
    "2. **Monitor key metrics** - Success rate, latency, cost\n",
    "3. **Set up alerts** - Get notified of errors\n",
    "4. **Use production traces for improvement** - Add edge cases to datasets\n",
    "5. **Version your prompts** - Track what changed when\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use consistent project naming** - `team-name/agent-name/version`\n",
    "2. **Document evaluators** - Explain what each one checks\n",
    "3. **Share interesting traces** - LangSmith has sharing links\n",
    "4. **Review traces together** - Great for learning\n",
    "5. **Set quality standards** - \"Must pass 90% of tests before deploy\""
