    "## What Are Dynamic Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a helpful assistant that can adapt its behavior based on who's asking for help. If you're a beginner, it speaks simply. If you're an expert, it uses technical language. If you're a Spanish speaker, it responds in Spanish. If you're a premium user, it has access to more powerful tools. That's exactly what **Dynamic Agents** do in LangChain 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Dynamic Agent** is an AI agent that changes its behavior, capabilities, or responses based on context—like the user's profile, the length of the conversation, or any other runtime condition you define.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Dynamic Agents Are NOT\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid confusion, here's what Dynamic Agents are NOT:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Not multiple agents stitched together**: It's a single agent that adapts, not several agents coordinating\n",
    "- **Not just prompt engineering**: While prompts can be dynamic, the power comes from changing tools, models, and execution flow\n",
    "- **Not conditional logic inside tools**: The adaptation happens at the middleware level, before tools even run\n",
    "- **Not role-playing tricks**: This is architectural flexibility, not instructing the model to \"pretend\" to be different things\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem Dynamic Agents Solve\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier versions of LangChain, if you wanted your agent to behave differently for different users or situations, this usually required either multiple separate agents or complex conditional logic spread throughout the codebase. This made applications hard to maintain and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Agents solve this by using **Middleware**—a powerful system that lets you modify how your agent behaves without rewriting your entire application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remember: What is Middleware?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of middleware as a \"filter\" or \"checkpoint\" that sits between the user's request and the AI model. Every time the agent is about to make a decision or call a tool, the middleware can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inspect** what's happening\n",
    "2. **Modify** the request (change the prompt, tools available, or even the model)\n",
    "3. **Make decisions** about what should happen next\n",
    "\n",
    "It's similar to security checkpoints at an airport—they don't change your destination, but they can check your credentials and decide what you're allowed to bring with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remember How Middleware Works: The Agent Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand middleware, you first need to understand the basic **agent loop**. Here's a simple visualization of how a request flows through the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Input → Context → Middleware → Model + Tools → Response\n",
    "                          ↑                ↓\n",
    "                          └────────────────┘\n",
    "                        (Can intercept and modify)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed flow looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. User sends a message\n",
    "2. Agent receives the message\n",
    "3. Agent calls the AI model (like GPT-4 or Claude)\n",
    "4. Model decides to either:\n",
    "   - Use a tool (like searching the web or querying a database)\n",
    "   - Respond to the user\n",
    "5. If it uses a tool, go back to step 3\n",
    "6. Finally, respond to the user\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Middleware can intercept and modify this loop at specific points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **before_model**: Runs before calling the AI model (Step 3)\n",
    "- **after_model**: Runs after the model responds (Step 4)\n",
    "- **wrap_model_call**: Wraps the entire model call (Steps 3-4)\n",
    "- **wrap_tool_call**: Wraps individual tool executions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two Types of Middleware: Decorators vs. Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain 1.0 offers two ways to create middleware, depending on your needs. These are informal categories—internally they all compile down to middleware hooks—but they represent different patterns for organizing your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Decorator-Style Middleware (Simple, Quick)\n",
    "\n",
    "Best for single-purpose modifications. You use Python decorators like `@dynamic_prompt` or `@wrap_model_call`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.agents.middleware import dynamic_prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "@dynamic_prompt\n",
    "def custom_prompt(request):\n",
    "    # This function runs before every model call\n",
    "    # and can return a modified prompt\n",
    "    return \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Class-Based Middleware (Powerful, Reusable)\n",
    "\n",
    "Best for complex logic or when you need multiple hooks working together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyCustomMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):\n",
    "    def before_model(self, state, runtime):\n",
    "        # Runs before model calls\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def after_model(self, state, runtime):\n",
    "        # Runs after model responses\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
