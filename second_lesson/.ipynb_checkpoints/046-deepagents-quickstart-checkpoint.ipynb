    "# DeepAgents Quickstart Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is DeepAgents?\n",
    "\n",
    "**DeepAgents** is a new experimental Python library from LangChain that helps you build **super-smart AI agents** capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way:\n",
    "- A **regular agent** is like a person who can use one or two tools to answer questions\n",
    "- A **DeepAgent** is like a project manager who can:\n",
    "  - Break down big tasks into smaller steps\n",
    "  - Create to-do lists and track progress\n",
    "  - Save information to files when things get complicated\n",
    "  - Delegate specialized work to other agents\n",
    "  - Remember things from previous conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepAgents is inspired by applications like:\n",
    "- **Claude Code**: An AI coding assistant that can plan, write, and debug code\n",
    "- **Deep Research**: An AI researcher that can investigate topics thoroughly\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use DeepAgents?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem It Solves\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular AI agents face challenges with complex tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context Limits**: LLMs have limited memory - they can only \"see\" a certain amount of text at once\n",
    "2. **No Planning**: Simple agents don't break down complex tasks into steps\n",
    "3. **Can't Delegate**: They try to do everything themselves\n",
    "4. **Forget Things**: They don't remember information from past conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "### The DeepAgents Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepAgents provides built-in tools to solve these problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | What It Does | Why It Matters |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Planning Tool** (`write_todos`) | Creates to-do lists and tracks progress | Breaks complex tasks into manageable steps |\n",
    "| **File System Tools** | Read/write files to store information | Prevents context overflow by saving data externally |\n",
    "| **Subagent Tool** (`task`) | Spawns specialized helper agents | Delegates work to experts while keeping main agent focused |\n",
    "| **Persistent Memory** | Remembers across conversations | Maintains continuity between sessions |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When Should You Use DeepAgents?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Use DeepAgents When:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your task has **multiple steps** that need planning\n",
    "- You're working with **large amounts of data** that won't fit in context\n",
    "- You need to **delegate specialized tasks** to different agents\n",
    "- You want your agent to **remember information** across conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Research agents that gather, analyze, and write reports\n",
    "- Coding assistants that plan, implement, and test features\n",
    "- Data analysis agents that process large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Don't Use DeepAgents When:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your task is **simple and straightforward**\n",
    "- You just need basic tool calling\n",
    "- You're building a simple chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "**For simpler cases**, use:\n",
    "- LangChain's `create_agent()` function\n",
    "- Basic LangGraph workflows\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Write Clear System Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Good prompts:\n",
    "- Define the agent's role clearly\n",
    "- Explain what tools are available\n",
    "- Describe the expected workflow\n",
    "- Give examples of good outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Choose Appropriate Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Use DeepAgents for:\n",
    "- Multi-step research\n",
    "- Code generation and testing\n",
    "- Data analysis pipelines\n",
    "- Document processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't use for:\n",
    "- Simple Q&A\n",
    "- Single tool calls\n",
    "- Basic chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Test Iteratively\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with simple tasks\n",
    "- Gradually increase complexity\n",
    "- Monitor agent behavior\n",
    "- Adjust system prompts as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Monitor Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepAgents can make many LLM calls:\n",
    "- Main agent calls\n",
    "- Subagent calls\n",
    "- Tool use calls\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- Using cheaper models for simple tasks\n",
    "- Setting usage limits\n",

    "\n",
    "### Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. API Key Errors\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Make sure keys are set correctly\n",
    "import os\n",
    "print(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:\", \"✅\" if os.getenv(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") else \"❌\")\n",
    "print(\"TAVILY_API_KEY:\", \"✅\" if os.getenv(\"TAVILY_API_KEY\") else \"❌\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Agent Not Planning\n",
    "- Make sure your task is complex enough\n",
    "- Check your system prompt encourages planning\n",
    "- Try explicitly asking for a plan\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Context Overflow\n",
    "- The agent should handle this automatically\n",
    "- If not, check that file tools are available\n",
    "- Consider breaking task into smaller pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Slow Performance\n",
    "- DeepAgents make multiple LLM calls\n",
    "- This is expected for complex tasks\n",
    "- Consider using faster models for simple subtasks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the basics, explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Persistent Memory**: Enable agents to remember across sessions\n",
    "2. **Custom Subagents**: Create specialized agents for specific domains\n",
    "3. **Production Deployment**: Use LangSmith for monitoring and deployment\n",
    "4. **Advanced Tools**: Integrate databases, APIs, and other services\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**DeepAgents** is a powerful framework for building sophisticated AI agents that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Plan and track complex tasks  \n",
    "✅ Manage large amounts of information  \n",
    "✅ Delegate work to specialized subagents  \n",
    "✅ Remember across conversations  \n",
    "\n",
    "While it's more complex than simple agents, DeepAgents excels at **multi-step, complex tasks** that require careful planning and execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: DeepAgents is still in a very early and experimental stage. Start simple, test thoroughly, and gradually increase complexity as you become comfortable with the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy building! 🚀"
