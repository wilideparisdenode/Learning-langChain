      "Short answer: There isn’t a single, universally accepted answer that satisfies everyone. The official history says Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy, acting alone; many later investigators have argued there was a conspiracy, but no definitive, public proof pinning down who else was involved has emerged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key points you should know\n",
      "\n",
      "- Warren Commission (1964): Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in shooting President Kennedy from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. Oswald was killed by Jack Ruby two days later, so no trial to test the theory in court. The Commission found no credible evidence of a conspiracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "- House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) (1979): Concluded Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy, though it did not identify all participants or provide a definitive alternative culprit. The HSCA also questioned the reliability of some evidence (notably the acoustics analysis) and left many questions unresolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Later scholarship and debates: \n",
      "  - Some historians and researchers argue Oswald acted alone (and became a convenient focal point for a complex event).\n",
      "  - Others endorse various conspiracy theories involving the Mafia, anti-Castro Cuban groups, CIA personnel, or other actors. None of these theories has produced universally accepted, public, verifiable evidence that has won broad consensus.\n",
      "\n",
      "- What the records show (and don’t show): A large body of declassified documents exists, but significant files remain redacted or disputed. The JFK Records Act mandated release of most documents, but not all. Ongoing/documented revisions continue to fuel debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "- How to evaluate theories: \n",
      "  - The “Oswald alone” explanation rests on the Warren Commission’s evidence about the rifle, Oswald’s presence at the TSBD, and ballistic analysis.\n",
      "  - Conspiracy theories typically point to alternate shooters, or hidden backers, or institutional involvement—but they often hinge on disputed interpretations of ballistic, eyewitness, or intelligence records.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want a deeper dive, I can give you:\n",
      "- A concise timeline of the shooting and the immediate aftermath, with the main pieces of physical evidence.\n",
      "- A quick side-by-side of the Warren Commission findings vs. HSCA conclusions.\n",
      "- A reading list with accessible summaries (e.g., Warren Commission Report, HSCA Final Report, plus popular books like Vincent Bugliosi’s Reclaiming History and Gerald Posner’s Case Closed) and guidance on what each argues.\n",
      "- A breakdown of the most persistent conspiracy theories and the strongest and weakest evidentiary points for each.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Warren Commission (1964) – Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone, fired the shots that killed John F. Kennedy from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. The Commission found no convincing evidence of a broader conspiracy and said Oswald acted alone. The famous “magic bullet” (the single-bullet theory) was their explanation for how a single rifle could wound Kennedy and Governor Connally.\n",
      "\n",
      "- House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) (1979) – This inquiry agreed Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy, but it could not identify all the participants. The Committee concluded there was a high probability of a second shooter, but the evidence did not establish who else was involved or how the conspiracy was organized. Their conclusions remain hotly debated.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Subsequent releases and scholarship – In the decades since, thousands of records have been released under the JFK Records Act, with many more still partially redacted or withheld. Researchers, journalists, and historians have produced a wide range of analyses. Most historians still treat Oswald as the shooter, but a substantial minority of researchers argue that a conspiracy (involving various combinations of Mafia figures, anti-Castro elements, CIA personnel, or other actors) is plausible or even likely. There is no definitive, universally accepted after-the-fact proof of who else, if anyone, was involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "What the evidence tends to show, and what remains uncertain\n",
      "- The shooting: The physical and ballistic evidence supports that Oswald’s rifle was used and that shots were fired from the sixth-floor window. The autopsy and ballistics data have been re-examined many times with mixed interpretations.\n",
      "- Oswald’s role: Oswald was on the Sixth Floor, had access to the rifle, and was captured shortly after the assassination. He denied involvement and was killed two days later by Jack Ruby, preventing a formal trial.\n",
      "- Possible conspiracies: The HSCA raised the possibility of a conspiracy, but it did not identify a definitive conspirator roster. Over the years, various theories have pointed to organized crime, anti-Cintra/Cuban exile groups, elements within the CIA, or other actors, but none of these have produced universally accepted, conclusive proof.\n",
      "- The record today: We have many declassified documents, but still not all the smoking-gun documents, and some interpretive gaps remain. The question of “who really killed JFK” is still debated largely because the evidence can be read in different ways, and some files are still withheld or redacted.\n",

      "- Give you a compact timeline of the key events and where the evidence points.\n",
      "- Map out the major theories, who supports them, and what evidence they rely on.\n",
