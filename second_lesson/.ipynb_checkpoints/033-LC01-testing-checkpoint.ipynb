    "# LangChain 1.0 Agent Development: Testing\n",
    "* There are a few approaches to testing your agents:\n",
    "    * Unit tests exercise small, deterministic pieces of your agent in isolation using in-memory fakes so you can assert exact behavior quickly and deterministically.\n",
    "    * Integration tests test the agent using real network calls to confirm that components work together, credentials and schemas line up, and latency is acceptable.\n",
    "* Agentic applications tend to lean more on integration because they chain multiple components together and must deal with flakiness due to the nondeterministic nature of LLMs.\n",
    "* To learn more about how to do testing, see the [documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/test)."
